Uses the PHP Framework Laravel. To get started you should probably run:
    mkdir application/config/local
    touch application/config/local/application.php
  
Inside the new file, add this:
    <?php
    return array(

        'url' => 'YOUR_LOCAL_URL',

    );
    ?>
where 'YOUR_LOCAL_URL' is the url for your local environment.
